  - M43

long:
  - When setting up or debugging a machine it's useful to know how pins are assigned to functions by the firmware, and to be able to find pins for use with new functions. `M43` provides these tools. `M43` by itself reports all pin assignments. Use `P` to specify a single pin. Use `I` to report the values on pins that are protected. Use `W` to watch the specified pin, or all pins. Use the `E` option to monitor endstops. Use `S` option to test a BLTouch type servo probe.  Use `T` option to toggle pins.
  - The `W` watch mode option continues looping, blocking all further commands, until the board is reset. If `EMERGENCY_PARSER` is enabled, `M108` may also be used to exit the watch loop without needing to reset the board.

notes:
  - Requires `PINS_DEBUGGING`. This feature should be disabled for production use.
