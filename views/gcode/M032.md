tag: m032
title: Select and Start
brief: Begin an SD print from a file.
author: thinkyhead

experimental: true
requires: SDSUPPORT
group: sdcard

codes:
  - M32

long:
  - The `M32` command exists to allow G-code to load other G-code files and run them as sub-programs. This can be useful to change the start / end gcode for a batch of files without having to edit them all.
  - For legacy reasons `M32` uses '`!`' (and '`#`') to delimit the filepath parameter. The filepath must be the last parameter.

notes:
  - Requires [`SDSUPPORT`](/docs/configuration/configuration.html#sd-card)
  - This is a seldom-used beta feature that needs more testing and use-cases.

parameters:
  -
    tag: P
    optional: true
    description: Sub-Program flag
    values:
      -
        tag: flag
        type: bool
  -
    tag: S
    optional: true
    description: Starting file offset
    values:
      -
        tag: filepos
        type: int

examples:
  -
    pre: Select and start a file at offset 5022.
    code: M32 S5022 !/boats/sailboat.gco
  -
    pre: Select and start a file from within G-code.
    code: M32 P !/models/lgbust.gco#
    post: The `#` suffix is needed when using `P` to "stop buffer pre-reading" so no commands after `M32` will go into the buffer until after it returns.
