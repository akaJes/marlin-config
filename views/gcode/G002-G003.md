title: Controlled Arc Move
brief: Add an arc movement to the planner
author: thinkyhead

experimental: false
since: 1.0.0-beta
group: planner

codes:
  - G2
  - G3

long: |
      `G2` adds a clockwise arc move to the planner; `G3` adds a counter-clockwise arc. An arc move starts at the current position and ends at the given XYZ, pivoting around a center-point offset given by `I` and `J` or `R`.

      This command has two forms:
      #### I J Form
      
       - `I` specifies an X offset. `J` specifies a Y offset.
       - At least one of the `I` `J` parameters is required.
       - `X` and `Y` can be omitted to do a complete circle.
       - The given `X` `Y` is not error-checked.
         The arc ends based on the angle of the destination.
       - Mixing `I` or `J` with `R` will throw an error.
      
      #### R Form
       - `R` specifies the radius. `X` or `Y` is required.
       - Omitting both `X` and `Y` will throw an error.
       - `X` or `Y` must differ from the current XY position.
       - Mixing `R` with `I` or `J` will throw an error.

      Arc moves actually generate several short straight-line moves, the length of which are determined by the configuration option `MM_PER_ARC_SEGMENT` (default 1mm). Any change in the Z position is linearly interpolated over the whole arc.
