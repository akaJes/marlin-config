title: Linear Move
brief: Add a straight line movement to the planner
author: thinkyhead

experimental: false
since: 1.0.0-beta
group: planner

codes:
  - G0
  - G1

long: |
    The `G0` and `G1` commands add a linear move to the queue to be performed after all previous moves are completed. These commands yield control back to the command parser as soon as the move is queued, but they may delay the command parser while awaiting a slot in the queue.

    A linear move traces a straight line from one point to another, ensuring that the specified axes will arrive simultaneously at the given coordinates (by linear interpolation). The speed may change over time following an acceleration curve, according to the acceleration and jerk settings of the given axes.

    A command like `G1 F1000` sets the feedrate for all subsequent moves.

    Marlin treats `G0` (rapid linear movement) as an alias to `G1` (rapid movement).

    By convention, most G-code generators use `G0` for non-extrusion movements (those without the E axis) and `G1` for moves that include extrusion. This is meant to allow a kinematic system to, optionally, do a more rapid uninterpolated movement requiring much less calculation.

notes: |
    - Coordinates are given in millimeters by default. Units may be set to inches by `G20`.
    - In Relative Mode (`G91`) all coordinates are interpreted as relative, adding onto the previous position.
    - A single linear move may generate several smaller moves due to kinematics and bed leveling compensation.
    - Developers, keep using `G0` for non-print moves. It makes G-code more adaptable to lasers, engravers, etc.
    - In a future version of Marlin, `G0` will do rapid movement, optionally, on SCARA machines.

    tag: Z
    optional: true
    description: A coordinate on the Z axis
    values:
      -
        tag: pos
        type: float
  -
    tag: E
    optional: true
    description: The length of filament to feed into the extruder between the start and end point
    values:
      -
        tag: pos
        type: float
  -
    tag: F
    optional: true
    description: The maximum movement rate of the move between the start and end point. The feedrate set here applies to subsequent moves that omit this parameter.
    values:
      -
        tag: rate
        type: float

examples:
  -
    pre: The most basic move sets a feedrate and moves the tool to the given position.
    code:
      - G0 X12   ; move to 12mm on the X axis
      - G0 F1500 ; set the feedrate to 1500mm/minute
      - G1 X90.6 Y13.8 ; move to 90.6mm on the X axis and 13.8mm on the Y axis
  -
    pre: There are some caveats related with feedrates. Consider the following&#x3A;
    code:
      - G1 F1500 ; set the feedrate to 1500mm/minute
      - G92 E0
      - G1 X50 Y25.3 E22.4 ; move while extruding
    post: In the above example the feedrate is set to 1500mm/minute, then the tool is moved 50mm on the X axis and 25.3mm on the Y axis while extruding 22.4mm of filament between the two points.
  -
    code:
      - G1 F1500
      - G92 E0
      - G1 X50 Y25.3 E22.4 F3000
    post: However, in the above example, we set a feedrate of 1500 mm/minute on line 1 then do the move described above, accelerating to a feedrate of 3000 mm/minute (if possible). The extrusion will accelerate along with the X and Y movement, so everything stays synchronized.
