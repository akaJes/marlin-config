tag: g12
title: Clean the Nozzle
brief: Perform the nozzle cleaning procedure.

experimental: true
since: 1.1.0
requires: NOZZLE_CLEAN_FEATURE
group: nozzle

codes:
  - G12

long:
  - Start the nozzle cleaning process. Three types of cleaning patterns are supported: straight strokes, zigzags and circles. This feature requires a dedicated cleaning area on or outside the bed, but within reach of the nozzle. The patten may be repeated as many times as desired.

notes:
  - Default behavior is defined by `NOZZLE_CLEAN_STROKES`, `NOZZLE_CLEAN_START_POINT`, `NOZZLE_CLEAN_END_POINT`, `NOZZLE_CLEAN_TRIANGLES`, `NOZZLE_CLEAN_CIRCLE_MIDDLE`, `NOZZLE_CLEAN_CIRCLE_RADIUS` and `NOZZLE_CLEAN_GOBACK`.
  - With `NOZZLE_CLEAN_GOBACK` enabled, the nozzle automatically returns to the XYZ position before `G12`.

        type: int

examples:
  -
    pre: The most basic example is to use the command without any arguments, this will default to a stroke based pattern which will be stroked `NOZZLE_CLEAN_STROKES` times.
    code: G12 ; stroke pattern (default)
  -
    pre: To generate a three triangle zig-zag pattern which will be stroked one time use the following command.
    code: G12 P1 S1 T3 ; zig-zag pattern with 3 triangles
  -
    pre: To generate a 10mm radius circle which will be stroked one time use the following command.
    code: G12 P2 S1 R10 ; 10mm circle
