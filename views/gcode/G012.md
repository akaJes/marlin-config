  - Default behavior is defined by `NOZZLE_CLEAN_STROKES`, `NOZZLE_CLEAN_START_POINT`, `NOZZLE_CLEAN_END_POINT` and `NOZZLE_CLEAN_PARK`.
  - With `NOZZLE_CLEAN_PARK` enabled, the nozzle automatically returns to the XYZ position before `G12`.

examples:
  -
    pre: The most basic example is to use the command without any arguments, this will default to a stroke based pattern which will be stroked `NOZZLE_CLEAN_STROKES` times.
    code: G12 ; stroke pattern (default)
  -
    pre: To generate a three triangle zig-zag pattern which will be stroked one time use the following command.
    code: G12 P1 S1 T3 ; zig-zag pattern with 3 triangles
