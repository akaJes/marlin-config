tag: m119
title: Endstop States
brief: Report endstop and probe states to the host.
author: thinkyhead

experimental: false
group: debug

codes:
  - M119

long:
  - Use this command to get the current state of all endstops, useful for setup and troubleshooting. Endstops are reported as either "`open`" or "`TRIGGERED`".
  - The state of the Z probe and filament runout sensors are also reported with this command.

notes:
  - The `BLTOUCH` probe only sends a brief pulse, so "`TRIGGERED`" indicates the probe is in error state.
  - Similarly, Trinamic's Sensorless Homing only sends a short pulse, so for these "`TRIGGERED`" is unusual.

parameters:

example:
  -
