tag: m155
title: Temperature Auto-Report
brief: Auto-report temperatures to host periodically.
author: thinkyhead

experimental: false
requires: AUTO_REPORT_TEMPERATURES,EXTENDED_CAPABILITIES_REPORT
group: hosts

codes:
  - M155

long: It can be useful for host software to track temperatures, display and graph them over time, but polling with `M105` is less than optimal. With `M155` hosts simply set an interval and Marlin will keep sending data automatically. This method is preferred over polling with `M105`.

notes:
  - Requires `AUTO_REPORT_TEMPERATURES` in `Configuration_adv.h`.
  - Also enable `EXTENDED_CAPABILITIES_REPORT` to notify hosts about this capability.

parameters:
  -
    tag: S
    optional: true
    description: Interval in seconds between auto-reports. `S0` to disable.
    values:
      -
        tag: seconds
        type: int

examples:
  -
    pre: Report temperatures every 4 seconds
    code: M155 S4
  -
    pre: Stop reporting temperatures
    code: M155 S0
