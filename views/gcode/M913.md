title: Set Hybrid Threshold Speed
brief: TMC driver switching to spreadCycle
author: mbuc

experimental: false
requires: HAVE_TMC2130 or HAVE_TMC2208,HYBRID_THRESHOLD
group: control

codes:
  - M913

long: 
  - When `HYBRID_THRESHOLD` is enabled, the TMC driver is switched from the quieter StealthChop to spreadCycle when the feed rate for a given stepper motor is over its `_HYBRID_THRESHOLD`.

    ### Individual Threshold Values
    - X_HYBRID_THRESHOLD
    - X2_HYBRID_THRESHOLD
    - Y_HYBRID_THRESHOLD
    - Y2_HYBRID_THRESHOLD
    - Z_HYBRID_THRESHOLD
    - Z2_HYBRID_THRESHOLD
    - E0_HYBRID_THRESHOLD
    - E1_HYBRID_THRESHOLD
    - E2_HYBRID_THRESHOLD
    - E3_HYBRID_THRESHOLD
    - E4_HYBRID_THRESHOLD
    

notes:
  - At least one parameter must be used.
  - Setting `X`, `Y`, `Z`, or `E` will set the hybrid threshold for all motors that fall under that category that have the `_IS_TRINAMIC` flag set.  See examples below.

parameters:
  -
    tag: I
    optional: true
    description: (>=1.1.9) Index for dual steppers. Use `I1` for X2, Y2, and/or Z2.
    values:
      -
        unit: index
        type: int
  -
    tag: T
    optional: true
    description: (>=1.1.9) Index (tool) number for the E axis. If not specified, the E0 extruder.
    values:
      -
        unit: index
        type: int
  -
    tag: X
    type: int
    optional: true
    description: Set `X_HYBRID_THRESHOLD` and `X2_HYBRID_THRESHOLD` to the provided value.
  -
    tag: Y
    type: int
    optional: true
    description: Set `Y_HYBRID_THRESHOLD` and `Y2_HYBRID_THRESHOLD` to the provided value.
  -
    tag: Z
    type: int
    optional: true
    description: Set `Z_HYBRID_THRESHOLD` and `Z2_HYBRID_THRESHOLD` to the provided value.
  -
    tag: E
    type: int
    optional: true
    description: Set `E0_HYBRID_THRESHOLD` and `E1_HYBRID_THRESHOLD` and `E2_HYBRID_THRESHOLD` and `E3_HYBRID_THRESHOLD` to the provided value.

examples:
  -
    pre: 'In this case, assume that `X_IS_TRINAMIC` and `X2_IS_TRINAMIC` are both enabled in `Configuration_adv.h`. '
    post: 'Both `X_HYBRID_THRESHOLD` and `X2_HYBRID_THRESHOLD` are set to 100.'
    code: M913 X100

  -
    pre: 'In this case, assume that `X_IS_TRINAMIC`, `X2_IS_TRINAMIC`, `Y_IS_TRINAMIC`, `E0_IS_TRINAMIC`, and `E2_IS_TRINAMIC` are enabled in `Configuration_adv.h`.'
    post: '`X_HYBRID_THRESHOLD` and `X2_HYBRID_THRESHOLD` are set to 100.  `Y_HYBRID_THRESHOLD` is set to 120.  `E0__HYBRID_THRESHOLD` and `E2_HYBRID_THRESHOLD` are both set to 30.  `E1_HYBRID_THRESHOLD` is not changed since the `E0_IS_TRINAMIC` flag is not set.'
