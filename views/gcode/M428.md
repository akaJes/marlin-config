title: Home Offsets Here
brief: Set home offsets based on current position
author: thinkyhead

experimental: false
requires: HAS_HOME_OFFSET
group: planner

codes:
  - M428

long: |
  Use `M428` to set a persistent offset to the native home position and coordinate space by assigning the current position as the native home position. See the example below.

  - The current position must be within 2cm from 0 or an endstop.
  - The current position is set to the native home position.
  - Any previous position shift from `G92` is cleared.
  - The home offset is persistent — added to the current position until changed.
  - Some uses include fine adjustment of Z position (without moving endstops) and shifting the coordinate space to print on a different part of the bed.

notes: |
  - Only the Z offset can be altered on `DELTA`.
  - This GCode can be disabled with `NO_WORKSPACE_OFFSETS` to optimize movement.
  - Changing the home offsets will not invalidate bed leveling or other saved data.
  - If `EEPROM_SETTINGS` is enabled, the home offsets are saved with `M500`, loaded with `M501`, and reset with `M502`.
  - Use [`M206`](/docs/gcode/M206.html) to set the home offsets directly.

examples:
  -
    pre: What was X=10 becomes X=0. So the X home offset becomes -10.
    code:
      - G1 X10
      - M428
