tag: m290
title: Babystep
brief: Babystep one or more axes
author: thinkyhead

experimental: false
since: 1.1.7
requires: BABYSTEPPING
group: calibration

codes:
  - M290

long:
  - Apply babysteps to one or more axes using current units. Offsets applied with `M290` aren't added to the current coordinates, but are intended for making small adjustments, especially in the Z axis, at the start of a print.
  - Note that when `BABYSTEP_ZPROBE_OFFSET` is enabled, `M290` also modifies the Probe Z Offset (with no immediate effects). The new Z offset applies to successive probing operations, and can be saved with `M500`. This behavior is means to coincide with the LCD Menu replacing "Z Babystepping" with "Babystep Z Probe Offset." To avoid this side-effect, use `M290 P0` or leave `BABYSTEP_ZPROBE_OFFSET` disabled.

notes: Requires `BABYSTEP_XY` for babystepping on the XY axes.

example:
  -
    pre: Babystep the Z axis by 0.25mm (in mm units mode)
    code:
      - M290 Z0.25 ; move up 0.25mm on the Z axis
