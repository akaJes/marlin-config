tag: m105
title: Report Temperatures
brief: Send a temperature report to the host.
author: thinkyhead

experimental: false
group: thermal

codes:
  - M105

long:
  - Request a temperature report to be sent to the host at some point in the future.

notes:
  - Some hosts may hide the reply from `M105`.
  - A better way for hosts to get regular temperature updates is to use `M155` (requires `AUTO_REPORT_TEMPERATURES` and `EXTENDED_CAPABILITIES_REPORT`). Hosts then no longer need to run an extra process or use up slots in the command buffer to receive temperatures.

  -

    optional: true
    description: Hotend index
    values:
      -
