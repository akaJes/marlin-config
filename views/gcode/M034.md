title: SDCard Sorting
brief: Set SDCard file sorting options.
author: thinkyhead

experimental: false
since: 1.1.0
requires: SDSUPPORT,SDCARD_SORT_ALPHA
group: sdcard

codes:
  - M34

long:
  - Marlin now contains support for SDCard alphabetical file sorting in the LCD menus. This feature uses free SRAM to create a sorting index for up to the first 256 files in the current folder, and (if you have _lots_ of SRAM) can optionally cache file listings for a more responsive UI. Buffering only occurs during file browsing. Otherwise the SRAM is freed.

notes:
  - Requires [`SDSUPPORT`](/docs/configuration/configuration.html#sd-card) and `SDCARD_SORT_ALPHA`.
